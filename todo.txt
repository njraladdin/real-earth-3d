i tested same colmap and same iteration number on official dataset and resutl was decent. 
problem was with our dataset. there hsould be way more overlap between images and only 20% new content in each image. rotate around a single object 

trying to match two seperate splats togehter looks sloppy. let's try making splats big, and merging them. 

limit images to 70, focused 

TODO    
- quantify quality of colmap model, done 
- test video (with more frames)
- add images to exisitng colmap model
- compare splats beofre vs after merging images (of a window for example, was it aded proeprly to the splat? )


test more places, only get picture then skip then picture. test rotating around object, then rotate naother object etc. 

test merging splats 


APPRAOCH: the whole thing be a single splat. to add new images, extract features and merge to exising colmap model, then rerun opensplat. 
so you can add a window, a chair etc. 
by seeing the splat, you can see which areas need more images. 
to expland, take images of slightly visible parts in the splat (meaning they can be matched to the splat)

the giant splat would be split in chunks when previewing on the web

--

simple preview a splat on the web in frontend

preview multiple connected splats 



future: 
dynamic splat map 
setup sky and nice effects 

set up proper backend (host files on firebase)
